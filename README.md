# triple-ten-sprint-projects--sprint-2

This project involves analyzing a modified version of the Instacart grocery delivery dataset, originally released in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The dataset has been adjusted to improve processing efficiency, with added missing and duplicate values while maintaining the original data's distributions.

The objective is to clean the dataset and prepare a report that provides insights into Instacart customers' shopping habits. The analysis will involve answering key questions, creating plots to visually communicate results, and documenting findings in markdown cells within a Jupyter notebook.

All visualizations should include titles, labeled axes, and legends, with plt.show() included at the end of each plotting cell to ensure clarity and presentation.
